Sales of a product esp. when it depends on the geographic location of the customer can be planned using this simple yet effective python library called folium. With Folium, one can create a map of any location in the world if its latitude and longitude values are known. This may greatly help in Diagnostic, Preventive and Prescriptive analytics.

1. Make sure you have pandas, folium and geopy libraries pre-installed. (If not use - pip install library_name)
2. Make sure the .csv file provided in the repository is in the same directory when you're running the program.
